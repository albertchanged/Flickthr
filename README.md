# Flickthr
A responsive, searchable image gallery using Flickr API, React, SuitCSS, and more!


## How to use it

In your terminal or command line (CL), type
1. `git clone https://github.com/albertchanged/Flickthr.git`
2. `cd Flickthr`
3. `npm run start`

   Then create a new terminal / CL tab within the same directory

4. `npm run build` (in the new tab) and wait for that to finish

Once both `npm run`'s have completed, open `src/index.js` in an IDE and
1. Comment out Line 7
2. Replace `${FLICKR.API_KEY}` on Line 23 with your own Flickr API key

Lastly, go to your browser and
1. Navigate to `localhost:8080`
2. Browse / click photos or find more using the search box
3. Have fun!
